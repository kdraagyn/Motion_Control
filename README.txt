Code for an arduino unit and processing program to a camara motion control rig. 

Primary-Goals:

1. Camara dolly rig that can be accurately controlled along the x-axis, z-axis rotation, and x-axis rotation.
2. Able to be controlled with a xbox controller or similar controller.
3. Accurate repeatable motion to allow for contolled stop motion or visual effects shots without the use of a green screen.

Fluff-Goals:

1. Controll program that allows for intuative control of the camara movement from a laptop. 
2. Records movement from any input to allow for infinite repeatability.
3. Control from non-traditional input like a MYO or rotating tripod head.
