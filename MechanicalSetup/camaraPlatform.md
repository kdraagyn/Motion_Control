Camara Platform:

The camara platform will provide a safe housing for a camara with a standard tripod mount.

Pitch axis:

This axis will be shaped like a 'U' with the camara mounted in the middle of the U's 
depression. The camara will be connected with a standard tripod mount (further research is 
necissary) along the cart's center of gravity. At the two uprights, there will be a an axle 
connecting it to the pan axis and a larger gear on both sides to except gearing from the panning axis stepper motor.

Pan axis:

This axis will be shaped like a 'U' as well, however at the base where it rests on the 
dolly platform it will be circular to allow for clean rotation along its axis. The 
uprights will be slightly larger than the pitch axis and will house either one or two 
stepper motors to rotate the pitch axis. At the base of the pan axis. There will be 
circular platfor with at least two wheels for support of the uprights and a larger
gear along the assembly's center of gravity to allow for greater torque and stability
for the assembly.

Dolly axis:

This axis will be circular to give the pan axis a stable platform to rotate on.
The platform will contact the dolly track and will contain wheels to minimize friction
along the rails. One main drive wheel to move the camara along the track.

Dolly rails:
These will provide a constant width path for the camera platform to move on top of.
