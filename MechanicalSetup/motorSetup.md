Motor description:

All of the axis will be controlled with stepper motors as they allow for greater accuracy
than a DC motor and they are able to rotate further than 360 degrees. 

Dolly axis: 

-This motor will be connected to a driver wheel that is in contact with the 
dolly track. 
-The motor type is still under consideration

Pan axis:

-This motor will be able to rotate the upper camara platform independantly from
from the platform on the dolly track.
-The motor type is still under consideration. 
-One option is a floppy disk drive motor as they have a sleek profile however may not 
provide a sufficient amount of torque to power the rig.

Pitch axis:

-This motor will be able to rotate the camara's horizontal axis (looking through lens) up 
and down independantly from the pan axis uprights.
-The motor type is still under consideration. 
-There may be two motors on both sides of the uprights or just a support on one and a 
motor on the other.
